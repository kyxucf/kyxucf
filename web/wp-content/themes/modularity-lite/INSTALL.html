		<h1>Modularity <span>Lite</span> Theme Instructions</h1>
		
		<h3>About this theme</h3>
		<p>Modularity Lite is a multimedia theme framework for Wordpress by <a href="http://graphpaperpress.com">GraphPaperPress.com</a>.  The theme design was developed with users who appreciate visual browsing and prefer a minimal layout, with their photos and multimedia featured front and center.  In the future, we will be releasing "child themes" to provide design alternative and additional applications (apps) that will work with Modularity Lite.  You'll definitely want to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GraphPaperPress">subscribe to GraphPaperPress.com</a> to get all the latest developments and enhancements for Modularity Lite.</p>
		
		<h3>Installing this theme</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Unzip the folder contained in the archive to your computer</li>
			<li>Upload the folder and its contents to the themes directory of your blog, located in <strong>&quot;wp-content/themes&quot;</strong> where WordPress is installed.</li>
			<li>Click on the Design tab from the WP admin panel, then select the theme to activate.</li>
			<li>Click on View Site at the top of the page.</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Initial Setup</h3>
		<p>Modularity is a 950px wide, one or two column theme, depending options you have chosen.  We need to set up your default image and thumbnail sizes to allow for easy posting and consistent design structure.  Click Settings - Miscellaneous and set your thumbnail size to 150 wide by 150px tall. Set your medium size images to 950px wide and 950px tall.  Post thumbnails are generated automatically by the functions contained in this theme.  By default, the theme pulls in the <strong>latest image</strong> uploaded to the post.  There is no need to use custom fields for adding post thumbnails.  Simply upload your images using Wordpress' new Add Media button, write a caption and description and click save.  While the theme will pull in the thumbnail automatically, it will not add the medium sized image to your post automatically.  For that, just click the insert image button just as you normally would.  If you need additionla instructions on uploading photos, inserting photo galleries and using the Wordpress interface, please view this <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2008/03/wordpress-25-rc2/">screencast</a>.</p>
		
		<h3>Theme Options Page</h3>
		<p>Click Design - Theme Options.  On this page you can modify background colors, link colors, add your contact info, welcome message and tracking code without touch a single line of code.  You can also enable or disable a right sidebar.  Switching between a one column 950 pixel wide theme and a two column 590 pixel wide theme plus a sidebar is now easier than ever before.</p>
		
		<h3>Widgets</h3>
		<p>There are a total of four widgetized areas on this theme.  The sidebar is a widget called, you guessed it, Sidebar.  The Sidebar only shows up if you enable Sidebars on the Theme Options page mentioned above.  The bottom three-column area is 100% widgetized.  From left, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Middle, and Bottom-Right.  You can add and delete widgets by clicking Design - Widgets, from within your Wordpress admin panel.</p>
		
		<h3>Multimedia Custom Fields</h3>
		<p>You can also add multimedia, including video, Google Maps, and virtually any type of embeddable media by entering "multimedia" as the key value and paste your YouTube, Vimeo, or any other html embed code into the value field.  You can read more about <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Custom_Fields">using custom fields here</a>.</p>
		
		<h3>Recommended Plugin</h3>
